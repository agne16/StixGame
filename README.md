Android game implementing the card game Stix

Stix is a strategy card game where players must match cards to a configuration of five sticks. At the start of a player's turn, the player may discard the corresponding matching card from his or her hand. If there is no match at the beginning of the turn, a stick may be moved with intent to match the configuration to another card in the hand. If there is still no match, the player must draw a card. The game end when a player (the winner) discard his or her whole hand.

When matching stick configurations to cards, all rotations and mirrorings are valid matches.
